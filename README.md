## Developing An Autonomous Dual-Chatbot System For Research Paper Digesting

In this project, we focused on solving the problem of efficiently digesting complex research papers. Toward that end, we developed a dual-chatbot system where one bot plays the "journalist" while the other bot plays the "author", and two bots are engaged in an interview. In doing so, the journalist bot can act on behalf of the user and query the key points of the paper. This is beneficial as it eliminates the need for users to devise their own questions - an activity that can be challenging and time-consuming, particularly when dealing with unfamiliar subjects.
